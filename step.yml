title: "Android Build for UI Testing"
summary: |-
  Builds your Android project with Gradle with the belonging AndroidTest variant.
description: |-
  [This Step](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-android-build-for-ui-testing) generates all the APKs you need to run instrumentation tests for your Android app: both an APK from your app and the belonging test APK, for example,  `:app:assembleDemoDebug`, `:app:assembleDemoDebugAndroidTest`
   
   ### Configuring the Step
   1. Add the **Project Location** which is the root directory of your Android project.
   2. Set the **Module** you want to build. To see your available modules, open your project in Android Studio and go to **Project Structure** and see the list on the left.
   3. Set the **Variant** you want to build. To see your available variants, open your project in Android Studio and go to **Project Structure** and then the **variants** section.
   Under **Options**:
   4. Set the **APK location pattern**: Once the build has run, the Step finds the APK files with the given pattern.
   5. **Set the level of cache** where `all` caches build cache and dependencies, `only_deps` caches dependencies only, `none` does not cache anything.
   6. If you wish to pass any extra Gradle arguments to the gradle task, you can add those in the **Additional Gradle Arguments** input.
