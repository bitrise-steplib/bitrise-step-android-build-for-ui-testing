<summary>Description</summary>

[This Step](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-android-build-for-ui-testing) generates all the APKs you need to run instrumentation tests for your Android app: both an APK from your app and the belonging test APK, for example,  `:app:assembleDemoDebug`, `:app:assembleDemoDebugAndroidTest`

 ### Configuring the Step
 1. Add the **Project Location** which is the root directory of your Android project.
 2. Set the **Module** you want to build. To see your available modules, open your project in Android Studio and go to **Project Structure** and see the list on the left.
 3. Set the **Variant** you want to build. To see your available variants, open your project in Android Studio and go to **Project Structure** and then the **variants** section.
 Under **Options**:
 4. Set the **APK location pattern**: Once the build has run, the Step finds the APK files with the given pattern.
 5. **Set the level of cache** where `all` caches build cache and dependencies, `only_deps` caches dependencies only, `none` does not cache anything.
 6. If you wish to pass any extra Gradle arguments to the gradle task, you can add those in the **Additional Gradle Arguments** input.
